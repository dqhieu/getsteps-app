## Where Steps Wins

### Step Tracking as a Core Feature

NRC is a running app first. It tracks steps passively through Apple Health, but there's no step-focused dashboard, widgets, or goals. Steps puts daily step counting front and center with 8 widgets, beautiful charts, and daily goals.

### Multi-Sport Tracking

NRC is built for runners. Steps supports 23+ workout types including running, cycling, hiking, swimming, yoga, strength training, and pickleball. One app covers your entire fitness routine.

### Widget Variety

NRC offers a single widget showing your last run. Steps provides 8 widget types — step counters, progress rings, weekly charts, and more. Your home screen becomes a complete fitness dashboard.

### GPX Export

Want to save your hiking trail or share a running route? Steps lets you export any workout route as a GPX file. NRC removed its route export feature and doesn't offer GPX downloads.

### Comprehensive Yearly Insights

Steps creates a Wrapped-style yearly recap covering all your activities — steps, workouts, streaks, and personal records. NRC provides monthly run summaries but nothing as comprehensive.

## Where Nike Run Club Wins

### Guided Runs

NRC's audio-guided runs with Nike coaches are excellent for runners of all levels. From beginner plans to marathon training, the coaching content is top-tier. Steps doesn't offer guided audio workouts.

### Social Features

NRC has challenges, clubs, and the ability to cheer friends on their runs. If social motivation drives your fitness, NRC's community features are strong.

### Running-Specific Analytics

For dedicated runners, NRC provides detailed split times, pace analysis, and running-specific metrics that are more refined than a general-purpose tracker.

### Brand and Community

Nike's brand brings a large, active community. Participating in global challenges and connecting with millions of runners is unique to NRC.

## Who Should Choose Steps?

Steps is the better choice if you:

- Want a dedicated step counter with widgets
- Track multiple workout types beyond running
- Need GPX export for routes
- Want yearly insights across all activities
- Prefer a clean fitness dashboard over social features

## Who Should Choose Nike Run Club?

NRC is better if you:

- Primarily run and want audio-guided coaching
- Value social challenges and community features
- Want running-specific training plans
- Don't need a dedicated step counter or multi-sport tracking

## Common Questions

### Can I use Steps and Nike Run Club together?

Yes. Both apps sync with Apple Health. You can use NRC for guided runs and Steps for daily step tracking and widgets. Your data stays synced.

### Does Steps track running as well as NRC?

Steps tracks running workouts with distance, pace, heart rate, and GPS routes. It doesn't offer audio coaching, but the running data itself is comprehensive.

### Is NRC really free?

Yes, NRC is completely free with no premium tier. Steps is also free with optional Pro features for power users.

### Which app is better for Apple Watch?

Both have native Watch apps. Steps offers more complication styles and better widget support on iPhone, while NRC provides a polished run-tracking experience on the watch.

## The Verdict

Nike Run Club is fantastic if running is your world. But for everyone else — walkers, hikers, cyclists, gym-goers — Steps is the more complete fitness companion. With 23+ workout types, 8 widget types, GPX export, and yearly insights, Steps covers your entire fitness routine in one app.
