## Common Questions

### Does Apple Watch count steps automatically?

Yes, Apple Watch counts steps automatically and stores them in Apple Health. However, a dedicated step counter app provides better visualization, widgets, complications, and goal tracking features.

### Which step counter is most accurate on Apple Watch?

Apps that use Apple's HealthKit data are equally accurate since they all read from the same motion sensors. The difference is in features, not accuracy.

### Can I see my steps on my watch face?

Yes, with apps that offer complications. You can add a step counter complication to most watch faces for at-a-glance access.

### Do I need my iPhone for step tracking?

No, Apple Watch tracks steps independently. Your data syncs to your iPhone when they're in range.
