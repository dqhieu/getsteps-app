## Where Steps Wins

### Dedicated Step Tracking

Strava doesn't track steps. It's built for logged workouts — runs, rides, swims. If daily step counting matters to you, Steps is the clear choice with a step-focused dashboard, widgets, and daily goals.

### Widget Experience

Steps offers 8 widget types for your iPhone home screen — step counters, progress rings, weekly charts, and detailed stats at a glance. Strava's single widget shows your recent activity, but nothing for daily steps.

### Free GPX Export

Both apps support GPX export, but Strava locks this feature behind its $11.99/month Summit subscription. Steps includes GPX export for free.

### Simpler Pricing

Strava's free tier is limited. Many popular features — route planning, segment leaderboards, training plans, GPX export — require Summit. Steps offers core features free, with an affordable Pro upgrade for power users.

### Streak Tracking

Steps motivates you with daily streak tracking — hit your step goal every day and watch your streak grow. Strava doesn't have a step-based streak system.

### Yearly Insights for Free

Steps generates a Wrapped-style fitness recap anytime. Strava's "Year in Sport" is available annually, but detailed training analysis requires a paid subscription.

## Where Strava Wins

### Social Network for Athletes

Strava's social features are unmatched. Activity feeds, kudos, comments, clubs, group challenges, and a massive global community make it the Instagram of fitness.

### Segments and Leaderboards

Strava's segment system lets you compete on specific routes against other athletes. Local leaderboards add a competitive edge that's unique to Strava.

### Route Planning

Strava Summit includes AI-powered route suggestions based on popular local routes. It's great for discovering new running and cycling paths.

### Advanced Training Analytics

For serious athletes, Strava provides training load, fitness/freshness scores, power analysis, and detailed performance metrics (Summit subscription required).

### Larger Workout Library

Strava supports 30+ workout types and has a strong community around cycling, running, and swimming. It's the default for many competitive athletes.

## Who Should Choose Steps?

Steps is the better choice if you:

- Want a dedicated daily step counter
- Love widgets and home screen customization
- Need free GPX export
- Prefer a simple, personal fitness tracker
- Want yearly insights and streak tracking
- Don't need social features or leaderboards

## Who Should Choose Strava?

Strava is better if you:

- Want social features, clubs, and community
- Compete on segments and leaderboards
- Need advanced training analytics
- Want route planning and discovery
- Are a competitive runner or cyclist

## Common Questions

### Can I use Steps and Strava together?

Yes. Both apps sync with Apple Health. Use Strava for social features and route tracking, and Steps for daily step counting and widgets. Your workout data stays synced.

### Does Strava track steps?

No. Strava tracks logged workouts (runs, rides, walks) but doesn't provide a daily step count or step-focused features. You need a separate app like Steps for that.

### Is Steps really free?

Yes. Step tracking, widgets, Apple Watch support, and GPX export are all free. Steps Pro unlocks additional features for power users at a fraction of Strava Summit's price.

### Which has better Apple Watch support?

Both have native Watch apps. Steps offers more complication styles and a richer iPhone widget selection, while Strava focuses on workout recording with live segments.

## The Verdict

Strava and Steps serve different purposes. Strava is a social fitness network for competitive athletes who want community, segments, and advanced analytics. Steps is a personal fitness tracker for everyday users who want beautiful widgets, daily step counting, free GPX export, and yearly insights. Many users find the best setup is using both together.
