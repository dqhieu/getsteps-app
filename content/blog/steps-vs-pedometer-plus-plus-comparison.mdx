## Where Steps Wins

### Workout Variety

Pedometer++ focuses exclusively on step counting and walking. Steps tracks 23+ workout types — running, cycling, hiking, swimming, yoga, strength, pickleball, and more. If you do anything beyond walking, Steps has you covered.

### GPX Export

Steps lets you export workout routes as GPX files. Whether you're hiking a new trail or running a new route, you can save and share your GPS data. Pedometer++ doesn't offer route export.

### Richer Widgets

Both apps offer widgets, but Steps provides 8 different widget types with more variety in size and design. You get step counters, progress rings, weekly summaries, and detailed stats — all on your home screen.

### Streak Tracking

Steps motivates you with daily streak tracking. Hit your step goal every day and watch your streak grow. Pedometer++ shows daily step data but doesn't track consecutive goal completions.

### Yearly Insights

At the end of the year (or anytime), Steps generates a Wrapped-style recap of your fitness data — total steps walked, longest streak, personal records, and highlights. Pedometer++ doesn't offer this.

### Personal Records

Steps tracks 8 personal records: fastest pace, most calories, earliest start, most elevation, longest duration, farthest distance, latest night, and max heart rate. It's a feature that rewards consistency.

## Where Pedometer++ Wins

### Simplicity

Pedometer++ is intentionally minimal. If you want an app that counts steps and nothing else, its straightforward interface is hard to beat.

### Badge Awards

Pedometer++ offers achievement badges for step milestones which can be motivating for some users who prefer that reward system.

### Established Track Record

Pedometer++ has been on the App Store since 2013. It has years of refinement and a loyal user base.

## Who Should Choose Steps?

Steps is the better pick if you:

- Track multiple workout types, not just walking
- Want GPX export for your routes
- Love detailed widgets and home screen customization
- Want streak tracking and yearly insights
- Care about personal records across 8 categories

## Who Should Choose Pedometer++?

Pedometer++ is better if you:

- Only need basic step counting
- Prefer the simplest possible interface
- Don't track workouts beyond walking
- Like badge-based achievements

## Common Questions

### Are Steps and Pedometer++ equally accurate?

Yes. Both apps read step data from Apple Health using the same device sensors. Step counts will be identical.

### Can I switch from Pedometer++ to Steps?

Yes. Since both apps use HealthKit, your historical step data is already available in Steps as soon as you install it. No data migration needed.

### Does Steps have a free tier?

Yes. Steps is free to download and use. Core features including step tracking, widgets, and Apple Watch support are available without a subscription.

## The Verdict

Pedometer++ is a great minimalist step counter, but it hasn't evolved much beyond basic step tracking. Steps offers everything Pedometer++ does plus 23+ workout types, GPX export, streak tracking, yearly insights, and 8 widget types. If you want more from your pedometer, Steps is the upgrade.
