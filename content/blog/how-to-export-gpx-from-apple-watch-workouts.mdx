# How to Export GPX from Apple Watch Workouts: Complete Guide 2026

Ever finished an amazing hike or discovered a perfect running route, only to realize you can't share it with friends? You're not alone. While Apple Watch excels at tracking workouts, exporting that GPS data as a GPX file isn't straightforward—until now.

This guide shows you exactly how to export GPX files from your Apple Watch workouts, whether you're using the built-in Workout app or a dedicated step counter like Steps.

## What is GPX and Why Does It Matter?

**GPX (GPS Exchange Format)** is the universal standard for sharing GPS routes. Think of it as a universal language that all mapping and fitness apps understand.

### Why You Might Need GPX Export

- **Share routes with friends** — Send that perfect trail to your hiking group
- **Import into other apps** — Use your routes in Strava, Komoot, or AllTrails
- **Create maps** — Visualize your adventures on Google Maps or specialized mapping software
- **Backup your data** — Keep permanent records of your favorite routes
- **Analyze performance** — Study elevation profiles and segment times in detail

## The Challenge with Apple Watch GPX Export

Here's the frustrating truth: **Apple doesn't offer native GPX export** from the Workout app. Your GPS data is locked inside Apple Health, visible only as colored lines on a map.

Your options for getting GPX files have traditionally been:
1. Use third-party desktop apps to extract Health data (complicated)
2. Manually recreate routes using mapping software (time-consuming)
3. Use a workout app with built-in GPX export (the smart choice)

## How to Export GPX with Steps App

Steps is one of the few pedometer apps that offers **direct GPX export** from any workout—no complicated workarounds needed.

### Step-by-Step: Exporting a GPX File

1. **Complete a GPS-tracked workout**
   - Open Steps on your Apple Watch or iPhone
   - Start a walking, running, hiking, or cycling workout
   - The app automatically records your GPS route

2. **Open the workout details**
   - After your workout, open Steps on your iPhone
   - Navigate to the Activities tab
   - Tap on the workout you want to export

3. **Export as GPX**
   - Scroll down to find the route map
   - Tap the share button or "Export GPX" option
   - Choose where to save or share the file

4. **Use your GPX file**
   - Import into Strava, Komoot, or AllTrails
   - Open in Google Earth for 3D visualization
   - Share directly with friends via AirDrop or message

## Tips for Better GPS Routes

Getting the best GPX data starts with quality GPS tracking:

### Before Your Workout

- **Enable precise location** — Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Steps > Precise Location
- **Start outdoors** — Let your device acquire GPS signal before starting
- **Keep your phone accessible** — Avoid deep pockets or bags that block signal

### During Your Workout

- **Stay in open areas when possible** — Dense forests and urban canyons can affect accuracy
- **Don't pause mid-route** — Pausing can create gaps in your track
- **Check signal periodically** — The Steps app shows GPS signal strength

### After Your Workout

- **Wait for sync** — Give the app a moment to process the complete route
- **Review the map** — Check that the route looks correct before exporting
- **Add notes** — Name your workout for easy identification later

## Common GPX Export Questions

### Can I export old Apple Watch workouts as GPX?

If your old workouts were recorded with the native Apple Workout app, you'll need a third-party tool to extract the data from Apple Health. For future workouts, using an app with built-in GPX export (like Steps) is much simpler.

### What's the file size of a typical GPX?

GPX files are surprisingly small—usually under 1MB even for multi-hour hikes. A typical 5K run might be just 100-200KB.

### Can I edit GPX files before sharing?

Yes! GPX is a text-based format. You can open it in specialized editors to trim unwanted sections, correct GPS drift, or add waypoints.

### Will exporting affect my Apple Health data?

No. GPX export creates a copy of your route data. Your original workout remains in Apple Health untouched.

## Why GPS Tracking Matters for Fitness

Beyond the practical uses, tracking your routes with GPS provides valuable fitness insights:

- **See your progress** — Compare routes over time to see improvement
- **Discover patterns** — Learn which routes challenge you most
- **Set segment goals** — Challenge yourself on specific portions of familiar routes
- **Create yearly maps** — Visualize everywhere you've walked, run, or hiked in a year
